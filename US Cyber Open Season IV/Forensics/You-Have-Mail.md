## Step1

When we read the email there is a part saying:

>Please see the attachment for my first piece of evidence. I am not
very good at understanding encryption details, but I did password
protect the file. The password is 53 65 63 75 72 65 5f 43 6f 64 65 3a
4f 72 64 65 72 5f 36 36.                     
Utilize a common number system to decrypt that password.

When we see it seems all we need is to convert assci code to according character..
