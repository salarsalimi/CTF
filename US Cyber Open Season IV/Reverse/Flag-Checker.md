# Introduction
This challange requies some basic python programming kwnoledge and reading code.

## Challange Discription

We found this cryptic Python script that validates the user's flag, but we're having trouble understanding the code. Can you find the correct flag that passes through the program?

## Step 1 

I have read through code and put comments in the code as needed with (#).
Also added some debug print() commands to check if i understood the logic correctly.

- Read code till the end
- Reverse the code to up 
    - for example list is gone through XOR (^) so do it one more time and it will be reversed
    - list arrays got -27 so +27 to reverse
    - And etc ...
